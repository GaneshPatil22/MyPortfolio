# My First Blog ðŸš€

Welcome to my blog! This post is written in **Markdown** and rendered inside React with Tailwind.

## Why Markdown?

- Easy to write
- Supports **headings, lists, code, images**
- Perfect for blogs and documentation

### Example Code Block

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("World"));
```
